# Genshin Impact Damage Calculator
A website that can calculate damage for each character based on their level, weapon, and artifact setup.
## Character
Each character has base atk, HP, and defense that is augmented based on their level and gear setup. Users can select a character to view their base stats as well as each Talent's base damage.
## Talents
Each character has select moves they can perform: Normal Attack Combo, Charged Attack Combo, Elemental Skill, Elemental Burst, and Plunge Attack. Each of these will be shown how much base damage they can do.
## Weapon
Each weapon has a base attack stat that augments with level. They also have secondary effects that can increase a variety of stats.
## Artifacts
There are a total of 5 artifacts a user can equip, each augmenting a variety of stats. Users will be able to select their type of artifact as well as the stat it boosts, and by how much. The type will determine what 2-set or 4-set boost the user has.
