        <h1>Genshin Impact Free Primogem Calculator</h1>
        <p>This calculator will take into account the various time-based methods of obtaining primogems to help set expectations when saving.<br>
        <b>Assumptions:</b><br>Battle Pass advances 10 levels every Monday, counting only the gems & Intertwined Fates.<br>
        Spiral Abyss gems are obtained on reset (1st and 16th of each month).<br>
        Only Intertwined Fates are counted from the Stardust shop. Assumed all 5 are purchased.<br>
        Event gems are obtained when they begin (i.e. login events last 2 weeks, but rewards are obtained in the first 7 days).</p>
